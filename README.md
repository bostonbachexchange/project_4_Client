## Pitch
HARMONY HAVEN is an app that will take your choir to the next level. 

## Premise
This platform allows choir members to connect to other members in their chorus. Users find choral works to practice and add to their repertoire list. Create an opportunity to connect and share ideas and build community. Users create profiles and add music to their available repertoire list. Users will be able to create profiles, log in, and view all available repertoire, and sign up for themselves. Excellence and artistry is right around the corner.
